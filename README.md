## Summary 

This repo contains the working project for Brainhack 2020

## Project definition 

### Background

This project will apply machine learning to predict, something.

### Tools 

The project will rely on the following technologies: 
 * This README is built in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), to structure the text.
 * Preprocessing will be done with `nilearn` and machine learning anlayses will rely on `scikit-learn`
 * The main summary and results of the project will live in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) 
 * Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests.

### Data 

Data will be obtaned from OpenNeuro.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - The current markdown document, completed and revised.
 - A gallery of the student projects at Brainhack 2020.
 - Instructions on the website about how to submit a pull request to the [BrainHack School website](https://github.com/BrainhackMTL/school) in order to add the project description to the website. 

## Results 

### Progress overview

The project is dependent on the available data. Currently in the process of finding publivly available data.

### Tools I'll learn during this project

 * **fMRI Data Processing**
 * **ML Scikit Learn**
 * **Pandas Data Manipulation**
